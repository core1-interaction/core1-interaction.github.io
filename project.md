#### Class Project: Harmonic Collection

**Choose a theme to explore visually throughout the semester.** Each week, you'll design and code an entry that contributes to a collection based on this theme. By the end of the semester, you'll **deliver a website featuring 10 programmed entries**, with the website design as an integral part of the project

Your theme should be broad enough to allow diverse content but specific enough to inspire weekly ideas for twelve weeks. (Example themes: your daily commute, songs heard around New York, or interesting words from articles)

In design, like in mathematics, a sequence follows a pattern—each item contributes to a larger story. You'll develop entries that incorporate the design focus and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills learned each week

In the final weeks, you'll refine your 10 entries to ensure they clearly communicate your theme and deliver a cohesive website. Re-organizing or adding content may be necessary to fully realize your vision <br><br>

---

*Requirements:*
* The website and entries must be responsive across different screen sizes
* Entries should have unifying visual elements
* All hyperlinks must work
* Each entry will incorporate that week's design focus
* Use a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tell your story <br><br>

*Midterm Review:* 

You'll present a refined version of your collection in a one-on-one meeting. Before this, discuss with classmates:
* How has your theme evolved?
* How does the content and design communicate the theme?
* Is the pacing of your collection considered? Are there opportunities for dramatic changes in pace?
* Can you establish a design template or system? When and how can you break it to add interest?

Prepare a short written paragraph explaining your theme so far and three new directions you could explore for the rest of the semester
