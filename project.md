#### Class Project: Harmonic Collection

**Choose a theme to explore visually throughout the semester.** Each week, you'll design and code an entry that contributes to a collection based on this theme. By the end of the semester, you'll **deliver a website featuring 10 programmed entries**, with the website design as an integral part of the project

Your theme should be broad enough to allow diverse content but specific enough to inspire weekly ideas for twelve weeks. (Example themes: your daily commute, songs heard around New York, or interesting words from articles)

In design, like in mathematics, a sequence follows a pattern—each item contributes to a larger story. You'll develop entries that incorporate the design focus and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills learned each week

In the final weeks, you'll refine your 10 entries to ensure they clearly communicate your theme and deliver a cohesive website. Re-organizing or adding content may be necessary to fully realize your vision <br><br>

---

*Requirements:*
* The website and entries must be responsive across different screen sizes
* Entries should have unifying visual elements
* All hyperlinks must work
* Each entry will incorporate that week's design focus
* Use a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tell your story <br><br>

*Midterm Review:* 

You’ll present a refined version of your collection to the classroom:
* You need to have 5 entries along with your main page
* Submit a short written paragraph explaining your process so far:
  - How has your theme evolved?
  - How do the content and design communicate the theme?
  - What is currently working well?
  - What isn’t working well, and how would you improve it moving forward?
  - What has been your favorite and least favorite topic so far?

Giving feedback is part of your grade, so be prepared to give feedback on at least one classmate’s presentation.
Additionally, how you present is also part of your grade, so be ready to discuss your project
