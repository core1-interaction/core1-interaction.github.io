+ After reading **[<u>Sue Breakell’s Perspectives: Negotiating the Archive</u>](https://www.tate.org.uk/research/tate-papers/09/perspectives-negotiating-the-archive)**, reflect on how the process of organizing and curating content relates to your work on the Harmonic Collection project.
  In a short response, reflect on the following:
  - How does Breakell’s discussion of archives inform the way you think about curating your Harmonic Collection project?
  - What choices do you make in selecting, organizing, and presenting content to create a cohesive narrative across your 10 entries?
  - How can you apply Breakell’s ideas about negotiation and interpretation to ensure your website design effectively communicates your chosen theme?<br>
  
  This reflection will help guide your design process as you refine your entries and consider the overall narrative your project communicates
