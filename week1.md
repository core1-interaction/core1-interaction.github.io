#### Week 1 <br>August 27<br><br>


*In Class*  
+ Get to know your classmates
+ Class Expectation / [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MUvA-rT5wbHm0lmuFQosuDWHbuqtpIjTAWMr-lMu8Fk/edit?usp=sharing)
+ [Harmonic Collection Project](project.md)
+ The Web: Then and Now<br><br>


*Assignments for next week*	
+ Complete this [**<u>Semester Start Survey</u>**](https://forms.gle/LfwJx38ck53pPj527). It will count towards your participation grade.
  
+ Bring **three thematic ideas** for your [**<u>Harmonic Collection</u>**](project.md) projects and be prepared to discuss them in class. Think of these potential themes as the overarching concepts you'll explore through a series of sketches. Your themes should be broad enough to allow for diverse content, but specific enough to inspire an idea each week for twelve weeks.  
Examples of themes: Your daily commute, songs heard around New York, or interesting words from articles.  

  Create a Google Slide or PDF presentation

    3 slides for each idea:  
    - Slide 1: A general explanation of the idea, including a visual representation  
    - Slide 2: Why you're interested in the idea  
    - Slides 3: Visual examples of sketches, inspiration, ideas, or relevant websites

  Be ready to share your presentation at the beginning of our next class

+ Download and familiarize yourself with [**<u>GitHub</u>**](https://github.com)/[**<u>GitHub Desktop</u>**](https://github.com/apps/desktop) and [**<u>Figma</u>**](https://www.figma.com). Use your New School email to sign up for an account
