[<span class="nav-color">Core 1: Interaction • PUCD 3396 Section I • Fall 2024</span>](https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/PUCD2035)

**Cultivate a strong foundation in interaction design principles and explore programming as a creative tool**   

Apply these principles across various platforms, experimenting with media, tools, and techniques to create interactive visual projects for the web. This journey culminates in the [**<u>Harmonic Collection</u>**](project.md) project—a semester-long assignment where you'll select a theme, design and code weekly entries, and compile them into a responsive website by the end of the semester.<br><br>
